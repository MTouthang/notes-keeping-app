# notes-keeping-app
Design a Notes Keeping Application using the MERN Stack
----

# These are the features that we can expect to find in your note app-
- The user should be able to register or log in upon first seeing the website (if already registered).
- The create note section should be available to logged-in users, from which they can make their notes and add them to the dashboard
- The user should have real-time access to the created note in order to conduct CRUD (Create Read Update and Delete) operations
- To help the user better understand when the note was written, the creation and modification dates should be given above the note.
- Every time a user adds a note, a new data-filled card is generated and displayed on the dashboard.
- The card background and font color should always be modifiable by the user.
- In order for the user to look for his note using the label that has been provided to it, a search feature is necessary.
